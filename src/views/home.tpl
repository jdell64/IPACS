    IPAC was designed as an open-source solution to "what servers/devices are on the network right now." It is designed
    to be a very simple, lightweight product to be one step up from spreadsheets as a CMDBs. This product is not meant
    to be a "one-stop shop" but a quick "whats on the network."
</p>
<p>
    Future iterations of this should have be able to have some ability to preform continuous monitoring, integrate with
    some common ticketing systems or larger change systems, and the intelligence to make suggestions to improve performance
    and capacity in a virtualized environment.
